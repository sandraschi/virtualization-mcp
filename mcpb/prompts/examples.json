Mount OS ISO\n2. Start VM in GUI mode\n3. Complete OS installation\n4. Install VirtualBox Guest Additions (for better performance)\n\n## Step 3: Configure Development Environment\n1. Install development tools (IDE, compiler, etc.)\n2. Set up SSH for remote access\n3. Configure port forwarding for any services you'll run\n4. Install and configure version control\n\n## Step 4: Create \"Clean Dev Environment\" Snapshot\nTake a snapshot once everything is configured. This allows:\n- Quick resets if something breaks\n- Easy cloning for multiple projects\n- Rollback after testing breaking changes\n\n## Step 5: (Optional) Create Template\nSave the configured VM as a template for:\n- Quick deployment of new dev VMs\n- Consistent team development environments\n- Rapid testing environment creation\n\nWould you like me to start creating this VM for you?"

    "output": "I'll help you diagnose the VM startup issue. Let me check the VM status first.\n\n## Common Startup Issues:\n\n### 1. VM State Issues\n- Check current state with `get_vm_info`\n- If stuck in \"Saved\" state, try resuming instead of starting\n- If \"Aborted\", may need to reset\n\n### 2. Resource Conflicts\n- Check if another VM is using exclusive resources\n- Verify enough host RAM is available\n- Check if VT-x/AMD-V is enabled and not locked by another hypervisor\n\n### 3. Disk Problems\n- Verify disk files exist and aren't corrupted\n- Check available disk space on host\n- Ensure disk isn't locked by another process\n\n### 4. Network Issues\n- If using host-only adapter, check if host-only network exists\n- If using bridged, verify the bridge adapter is available\n\n### Quick Diagnostics:\n1. Get VM info to see current state and configuration\n2. Check VirtualBox logs (shown in VM info)\n3. Try starting in headless mode first (less resource-intensive)\n4. If all else fails, create a new VM and attach the existing disk\n\nWhat's the name of the VM that won't start? I'll check its status for you."
