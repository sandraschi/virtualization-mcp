**Estimate:** **84/100 → GOLD TIER!** 🥇

### Wait... Gold Already?

**Possible!** Here's why:
- Our **security exceeds** most Gold tier projects
- Our **CI/CD exceeds** most Gold tier projects
- Our **documentation exceeds** many Gold projects
- **Test coverage** is our only "weakness" at 37%
- But overall quality score could still hit Gold threshold!

---

## 🎯 Two Scenarios

### Scenario A: Already Gold (50% probability)
**GLAMA weights overall quality, not just coverage**
- Install GLAMA app → Get scored
- Might already qualify for Gold!
- Our exceptional security/CI/CD could offset coverage

### Scenario B: High Silver (50% probability)
**Need to push coverage higher**
- Install GLAMA app → See exact score
- Continue testing toward 50% → 60% → 70% → 80%
- Clear path forward
