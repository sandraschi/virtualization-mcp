## üîó Frame Continuity System

### How Continuity Works

The VeoGen continuity system ensures smooth transitions between scenes:

1. **Frame Extraction**: 
   - Uses FFmpeg to extract the final frame from each clip
   - Captures exact visual state at scene end
   - Preserves lighting, composition, and character positions

2. **Style Transfer**: 
   - Applies consistent color grading across clips
   - Maintains visual style coherence
   - Adjusts lighting and tone for consistency

3. **Seamless Transitions**: 
   - Generates next scene starting from previous end frame
   - Minimizes visual discontinuity between scenes
   - Maintains character and object consistency

4. **Quality Control**: 
   - Automated assessment of transition quality
   - Retry generation if continuity issues detected
   - Manual override options for fine-tuning

### Technical Implementation

```python
# Simplified continuity workflow
def generate_movie_with_continuity(script, style):
    clips = []
    last_frame = None
    
    for scene in script.scenes:
        if last_frame:
            # Use last frame as reference for next scene
            clip = generate_video(
                prompt=scene.description,
                style=style,
                reference_frame=last_frame,
                continuity_strength=0.8
            )
        else:
            # First scene - no reference needed
            clip = generate_video(
                prompt=scene.description,
                style=style
            )
        
        clips.append(clip)
        last_frame = extract_final_frame(clip)
    
    return assemble_movie(clips)
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: My movie script doesn't match my concept**
A: Try being more specific in your initial concept. Include genre, tone, key visual elements, and story structure. The AI works better with detailed input.

**Q: Scenes don't flow well together**
A: Edit the script to add transition notes and ensure character/setting consistency between scenes. Check for logical narrative progression.

**Q: Frame continuity isn't working properly**
A: Ensure scenes have compatible settings and lighting. Some style combinations work better than others. Consider using more consistent scene descriptions.

**Q: Generation is taking too long**
A: Movies with many clips take longer to generate. Consider breaking large projects into smaller segments or generating during off-peak hours.

**Q: Video quality is inconsistent across scenes**
A: Make sure all scenes use the same style setting. Check that scene descriptions have similar levels of detail and complexity.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Start Small**: Begin with shorter movies (5-8 clips) to learn the system
2. **Consistent Settings**: Use compatible settings across all scenes
3. **Review Scripts**: Carefully review and edit scripts before generation
4. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of quota and cost consumption
5. **Plan Ahead**: Schedule large movie generation during off-peak times
