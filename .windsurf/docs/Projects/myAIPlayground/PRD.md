# myAIPlayground - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
myAIPlayground is a comprehensive suite of AI applications and tools managed through a centralizedashboard. It provides a modular platform for various AI-powered applications including document processing, media management, and interactive AI experiences. The system supports multiple LLM backends (local and cloud-based) and is designed with a focus on extensibility and user experience.

## 2. Problem Statement
AI tools and applications are often developed in isolation, leading to:
- Duplicate infrastructure and setup requirements
- Inconsistent user experiences across different AI tools
