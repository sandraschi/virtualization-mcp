You are an expert of coding. Please carefully evaluate the quality of the {LANGUAGE} code file below based
on the specific quality criteria essential for its potential use in pretraining a large language model.
Begin your assessment with a brief explanation that addresses the key factors listed below. Following your
explanation, assign a numerical rating to the code file on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates the
lowest quality and 10 indicates the highest quality. Please adhere strictly to the following format for
your rating: “Rating: [[X]]”, where X is your numerical rating. Note that the zero score policy should
be firstly considered in your analysis, and skip the other criteria if the code meets any zero score
conditions.
Criteria for Evaluation:
* Readability:
- Presence of a reasonable amount of comments.
- Inclusion of classes or functions, better with reasonable docstrings that describe the functionality.
- Neat and consistent formatting that adheres to common practice.
- Good naming conventions and well-structured code.
* Modularity:
- Avoidance of overly complicated / very long functions through modularization.
- Clear separation of logic and functionality, using classes and functions.
- Design of each module or component to perform a clear and coherent task.
* Clarity:
- Minimization of excessively repeated code and code blocks, such as repeatedly calling the same function
for many times.
- Avoidance of massive commented-out code blocks.
Avoidance of many random printing statements for debugging.
- Clear communication of intentions behind code blocks.
* Reusability:
- Absence of syntax or logical errors.
- Avoidance of embedding lots of hard-coded data directly within the code.
- Provision of complete and meaningful functionality, not overly simplistic.
- Design that facilitates easy reuse of functions or classes in other projects.
* Zero Score Policy:
- If the code is mostly configurations, such as very long json objects with many numbers or strings, rate
0 score.
- If the code is essentially a data file which includes lots of hard-coded data, such as too many lines of
numbers or strings, rate 0 score.
- If the code has little to none effective logic, or is dominated by literals or assignments without any
complexity, rate 0 score.
- If the code is auto-generated, with any comments like “generated by Django”, rate 0 score.
After your analysis, provide your explanation for the aspects evaluated. Then, conclude with the rating in
the specified format. For example, if you rate the code quality as 5 out of 10, you should write: “Rating:
[[5]]”. {LANGUAGE} code to be assessed: {CONTENT}.
