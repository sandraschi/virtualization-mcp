# Angular

## Overview
Angular is a TypeScript-based, open-source web application framework developed by Google. It is a complete rewrite of AngularJS and is known for its opinionated structure, which provides developers with a robust and scalable foundation for building large, enterprise-grade applications. Angular is a comprehensive solution that includes everything from routing and state managemento a powerful command-line interface (CLI).

## Core Concepts

### 1. Modules (NgModules)
Angular applications are modular, and Angular has its own modularity system called NgModules. Every Angular app has at least one root module, conventionally named `AppModule`, which provides the bootstrap mechanism that launches the application. NgModules collect related components, directives, pipes, and services, and can be combined with other modules to build an application.

### 2. Components are the fundamental building blocks of angular application. A component controls a patch of screen called a view. It consists of three main parts:
- **A Template (HTML)**: Defines the view of the component.
- **A Class (TypeScript)**: Contains the application logic andata for the component.
- **Metadata (Decorator)**: The `@Component` decorator provides Angular withe information it needs to process the component, such as itselector, template, and styles.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'My Angular App';
}
```

### 3. Data Binding
Angular supportseveral forms of data binding to connect your component's data with its template:
- **Interpolation**: `{{ value }}` - Binds a value from the componento the template.
- **Property Binding**: `[property]="value"` - Binds a component property to a DOM element property.
- **Event Binding**: `(event)="handler()"` - Binds a component method to a DOM event.
- **Two-Way Binding**: `[(ngModel)]="property"` - Combines property and event binding to keep the component and view in sync.

### 4. Dependency Injection (DI)
Dependency Injection is a core design pattern in Angular. It is used to provide components withe services or other dependencies they need. Angular's DI framework provides dependencies to a class upon instantiation. You configure an injector with providers that can create andeliver services.

### 5. Services are singleton objects that get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. They are used torganize and share business logic, models, or datand functions with other components in angular application. Common use cases include data fetching, logging, and application configuration.

## Ecosystem & Tooling

### Angular CLI
The Angular Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for initializing, developing, scaffolding, and maintaining Angular applications directly from a command shell.
- **Key Commands**: `ng new` (create a new app), `ngenerate` (create new components, services, etc.), `ng serve` (run the development server), `ng build` (build for production).

### Angularouter
Angular's official router provides advanced client-side navigation and routing capabilities. It enables developers to build single-page applications with multiple views and allows navigation between them without a full page reload.
- **Features**: Lazy loading of modules, route guards for protecting routes, and nested routes.

### RxJS (Reactivextensions for JavaScript)
Angular makes heavy use of RxJS, a library foreactive programming using Observables, to work with asynchronous operations. HTTP requests, for example, return Observables.

## Why Use Angular?
- **Opinionated & Structured**: Provides a clear structure and best practices, which is beneficial for large teams and enterprise-scale projects.
- **Powerful Tooling**: The Angular CLIs one of the most comprehensive and powerful command-line tools available for any framework.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, making it a strong choice for complex applications.
- **Cross-Platform**: Can be used to build web applications, native mobile apps (with NativeScript), andesktop applications (with Electron).
- **Strong Corporate Backing**: Developed and maintained by Google, ensuring long-term support and a rich ecosystem.
