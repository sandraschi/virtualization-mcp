## Accessing Global Services

### Single Developer Setup
All global services are accessible from any repository with a `.windsurf` directory. The services are designed to work together seamlessly while maintaining security and isolation between projects.

### Multi-Developer Environment
For teams, we recommend setting up a centralized server with secure access via Tailscale VPN. See [Multi-Developer Setup](ide/windsurf/global_services/./multi_developer_setup.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Centralized service architecture
- Network configuration with Tailscale
- Security implementation
- Developer workstation setup
- Monitoring and SIEM integration

## Versioning

Global services follow semantic versioning (SemVer) where applicable. Each service's version is tracked independently.

## Contributing

To contribute to global services, follow the contribution guidelines in the [Windsurf Core Repository](https://github.com/windsurf-ai/core).
