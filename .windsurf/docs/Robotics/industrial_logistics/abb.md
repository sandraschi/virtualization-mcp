## Key Robot Series

### IRB Series (Industrial Robots)
ABB's portfolio includes a vast range of industrial robots, identified by the IRB (Industrial RoBot) designation, tailored for various payloads and applications.
- **Examples**: IRB 120 (small footprint), IRB 1600 (general purpose), IRB 6700 (high payload).
- **Applications**: Welding, material handling, assembly, painting, packing, and palletizing.

### GoFa & SWIFTI (Collaborative Robots)
GoFand SWIFTI are ABB's primary collaborative robots (cobots), designed to work safely alongside human workers withouthe need for extensive safety fencing.
- **GoFa (CRB 15000)**: Designed for higher payloads (up to 5 kg) and longereaches, suitable for tasks like machine tending and material handling.
- **SWIFTI (CRB 1100)**: Focused on high-speed collaboration, combining the speed of an industrial robot withe safety of a cobot, ideal for assembly and polishing tasks.

### YuMi (Collaborative Robot)
YuMi (You and Me) is a dual-arm cobot designed for small parts assembly and inspection tasks, particularly in thelectronics industry.
- **Features**: Two dexterous arms with integrated grippers, cameras, and sensitive force-control technology, allowing for safe and precise interaction.

## Core Technology & Software

- **RobotWare**: ABB's proprietary robot controller software, which provides the flexibility and functionality to control robot motion and application processes.
- **RobotStudio**: An offline programming and simulation tool that allows users to create, test, and optimize robot installations in a virtual environment. This reduces commissioning time and increases productivity.
- **OmniCore Controller**: ABB's latest generation of robot controllers, offering enhanced performance, scalability, and built-in digital connectivity.
- **ABB Ability™ Connected Services**: A suite of digital services that provides predictive maintenance, remote monitoring, and optimization for entire fleets of robots, delivered via the cloud.

## Impact and Future Direction
ABB has been a driving force industrial automation for decades. The company is heavily invested in developing flexible and intelligent automation solutions for the 'factory of the future,' with a strong focus on AI-powered robotics, mobile robotics (through its acquisition of ASTI Mobile Robotics), and simplifying the programming andeployment of robots for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Their strategy emphasizesoftware, digital services, and collaborative automation to meethe growing demand for customized products and resilient supply chains.
