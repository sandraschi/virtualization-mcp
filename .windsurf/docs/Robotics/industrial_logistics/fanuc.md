# FANUCorporation

## Overview
FANUC (Fuji Automatic NUmerical Control) is a Japanese group of companies that provide automation products and servicesuch as robotics and computer numerical control (CNC) wirelessystems. FANUC is one of the largest makers of industrial robots in the world and is a dominant player in the global CNC market. Their iconic yellow robots are a common sight in manufacturing facilities worldwide.

## Company History
- **1956**: Dr. Seiuemon Inaba, the founder, develops the first NC (Numerical Control) in the Japanese private sector.
- **1972**: The Computing Control Division becomes independent and FANUC Ltd. is founded.
- **1974**: The first FANUC robot is developed and installed in-house for internal production.
- **1977**: FANUC beginselling its industrial robots to the public.
- **1982**: FANUC enters a joint venture with General Motors, formingMFanuc Robotics Corporation in the USA.

## Key Robot Series

### General Purpose Robots
FANUC offers an extensive range of articulated robots for virtually any industrial application.
- **Examples**: LR Mate series (compactabletop), M-20iA series (high performance), R-2000iC series (heavy-duty).
- **Applications**: Material handling, machine tending, welding, assembly, and cutting.

### Collaborative Robots (CR series)
FANUC's line of green collaborative robots (cobots) is designed to work safely alongside humans withouthe need for safety fences.
- **Features**: Highly sensitive contact detection, a soft outer shell, and adherence to strict safety standards (ISO 10218-1). They can be taught by hand guiding.
- **Payloads**: From 4 kg (CR-4iA) up to 35 kg (CR-35iA), one of the highest payloads for a cobot on the market.

### SCARA Robotselective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA) robots are designed for high-speed, high-precision pick-and-place and assembly operations.
- **Features**: Optimized for speed and precision in a planar workspace.
- **Examples**: SR-3iA, SR-6iA.

### Delta Robots (GENKOTSU series)
Parallel-link robots designed for extremely high-speed picking and packing, especially in the food and pharmaceutical industries.
- **Features**: Often integrated with FANUC's iRVision systems for visual tracking.
- **Examples**: M-1iA, M-2iA.

## Core Technology & Software

- **CNC Systems**: FANUC is the market leader in Computer Numerical Control systems, which are the brains behind machine tools.
- **iRVision**: A fully integrated visual detection system that enables FANUC robots to 'see'. It is built directly into the robot controller, eliminating the need for a separate PC.
- **Force Sensors**: Provides robots with a sense of touch, allowing for complex assembly and inspection tasks that require precise force control.
- **ROBOGUIDE**: FANUC's offline programming software, which allows users to simulate robot applications, test motion, and perform cycle time analysis from a PC. Thisignificantly reducesystem integration time and risk.
- **ZDT (Zero Down Time)**: A cloud-based predictive maintenance service that monitors thealth of entire robot fleets, identifying potential issues before they cause downtime.

## Impact and Future Direction
FANUC's reputation is built on reliability and performance, with a strong emphasis on lifetime support and maintenance for its products. The company's 'service first' philosophy has earned it a loyal customer base, particularly in the automotive and electronics industries. FANUContinues to innovate in AI-driven automation, with a focus on deep learning for vision systems and advanced analytics for predictive maintenance through its ZDT platform.
