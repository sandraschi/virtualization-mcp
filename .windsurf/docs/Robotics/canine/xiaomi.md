# Xiaomi CyberDog

## Overview
Xiaomi's CyberDog is a series of bio-inspired quadruped robots created to foster a global open-source community of developers, engineers, and robotics enthusiasts. Rather than positioning it as a direct consumer or industrial product, Xiaomi has presented CyberDog as an advanced, accessible platform for exploring the future of robotics. Its primary goal is to spur innovation by providing powerful hardware and a customizable software stack to the community.

## Company Info
- **Developer**: Xiaomi Corporation
- **Initial Announcement**: August 2021
- **Website**: [mi.com/global/discover/news/cyberdog](https://www.mi.com/global/discover/news/cyberdog)

## Product Evolution

### CyberDog (1st Generation, 2021)
The first CyberDog was a bold statement, released in limited quantities (1,000 units) to Xiaomi fans, engineers, and enthusiasts to kickstarthe community.
- **Performance**: Powered by the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform, a powerful AI supercomputer for embedded systems.
- **Mobility**: Capable of high-speed movement (up to 3.2 m/s) and complex maneuvers like backflips.
- **Design**: Had a more industrial, raw-tech aesthetic.

### CyberDog 2 (2023)
The second generation marked a significant leap forward in design, intelligence, and mobility, making the robot smaller, lighter, and more life-like.
- **Design**: Doberman-inspired appearance, making it look more like a pet. It isignificantly smaller and lighter than its predecessor, weighing 8.9 kg.
- **Intelligence**: Powered by Xiaomi'self-developed NX chip, supported by dual co-processors. It features a more advanced sensor andecision-making system.
- **Mobility & Dexterity**: Enhanced with Xiaomi's CyberGear Micro-actuators, which improve the robot's mobility and allow ito performore difficult maneuvers, such as continuous backflips and fall recovery.

## Technology Stack
CyberDog is built on a foundation of cutting-edge robotics technology, with a strong emphasis on perception and AI.

- **AI Processing**: 
  - **Gen 1**: NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX
  - **Gen 2**: Xiaomi-developed NX chip + 2 co-processors
- **Perception System**: The robot is equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite for comprehensivenvironmental awareness:
  - **AInteractive Camera**: For computer vision tasks.
  - **Intel RealSense D450 Depth Camera**: For 3D mapping and navigation.
  - **Fisheye Cameras**: Providing a wide field of view.
  - **LIDAR Sensor**: For precise distance measurement and mapping.
  - **ToF (Time-of-Flight) Sensor**
  - **Voice & Touch Sensors**: For human-robot interaction.
- **Dynamicontrol**: Xiaomi's in-house developed high-performance servo motors and micro-actuators provide precise, high-torque control over the robot's 19 degrees ofreedom (in CyberDog 2), enabling dynamic balancing and complex actions.
- **SLAM**: The robust perception system allows the robot to perform autonomousimultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to navigate and map unknown environments.

## Open-Sourcecosystem
Xiaomi'strategy revolves around building a collaborative community.
- **Open Platform**: The code and hardware designs are shared, allowing developers to modify, customize, and build upon the platform.
- **Community Support**: Xiaomi has fostered a community for developers to share their work, collaborate on projects, and push the boundaries of whathe robot can do.
- **Goal**: To accelerate the development and adoption of robotics by crowdsourcing innovation.

## Market Positioning & Use Cases
Unlike competitors focused on industrial or commercial sales, CyberDog is a developer-first platform.
- **Target Audience**: Primarily robotics researchers, university students, and advanced hobbyists.
- **Use Cases**: The applications are defined by the community and include:
  - **Research**: A platform foresearch in locomotion, AI, computer vision, and human-robot interaction.
  - **Education**: A hands-on tool for teaching advanced robotics and programming.
  - **Custom Applications**: The possibilities are vast, from creating custom companion behaviors to developing novel service applications.
