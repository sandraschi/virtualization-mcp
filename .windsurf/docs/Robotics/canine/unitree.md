## Key Robots

### Go Series (Quadruped)
Thiseries represents Unitree's most popular and accessible line of quadruped robots.

- **Go1 (2021)**: A small, agile robothat gained massive popularity for its affordability and capabilities. It introduced features like intelligent side-follow, allowing ito walk alongside a human operator. It was offered in several tiers (Air, Pro, Edu) to cater to different needs.
- **Go2 (2023)**: The successor to Go1, the Go2 featuresignificant upgrades, including a more robust build, improved battery life, and enhanced AI capabilities. A key feature is the integration of a 4D LIDAR sensor and the ability to incorporate a GPT-based large language model, allowing for natural language commands and more intelligent interaction.

### B Series (Industrial Quadruped)
The B series is designed for more demanding industrial applications.

- **B1 & B2**: These are larger, more rugged robots withigher payload capacities and ingress protection ratings (e.g., IP68 on the B2), making them suitable for outdoor and harsh environments. They are targeted for tasks like industrial inspection, public safety, and academic research in real-world conditions.

### H1 (Humanoid)
Announced in 2023, the H1 is Unitree's first general-purpose humanoid robot, marking the company's ambitious entry into the humanoid space.
- **Specifications**: Stands approximately 1.8 meters tall, weighs around 47 kg, and features high-torque joints.
- **Achievements**: In early 2024, the H1 set a neworld speed record for a full-size humanoid robot, reaching 3.3 m/s (7.4 mph).
- **Technology**: Equipped with a 3D LiDAR and a depth camera for perception, it is designed for a wide range of applications, from research to eventual real-world assistance.

## Core Technology
Unitree's competitive advantage lies in its in-house development of core robotics components.

- **High-Performance Joints**: The company designs and manufactures its own high-torque, lightweight motors and harmonic drive gearboxes. This vertical integration is key to keeping costs down while maintaining high performance.
- **Advanced Locomotion Control**: Unitree has developed sophisticated control algorithms that enable jejich robots to maintain dynamic stability across a variety of terrains, perform acrobatic maneuvers, and recover from disturbances.
- **AI and Perception**: The robots arequipped with a suite of sensors (LIDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) and powerful onboard computers (oftenVIDIA Jetson platforms) to run AI models for autonomous navigation, object recognition, and human interaction.
- **Open SDK**: Unitree provides a comprehensive SDK for its robots, with support forOS (Robot Operating System). This openness has been crucial in fostering a large and active community of developers and researchers.

## Market Impact and Strategy
Unitree's primary strategy has been to drastically lower the price point for advanced legged robots. While competitors' robots often costens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, Unitree has consistently offered its products for a fraction of that price. This has had several effects:

- **Democratization of Research**: Universities and smalleresearch labs canow afford to work with advanced robotic platforms.
- **Growth of a Developer Ecosystem**: The low cost and open SDK have spurred innovation and created a vibrant community around the platform.
- **Competitive Pressure**: Unitree has forced thentire industry to reconsider pricing and accessibility.

The company's expansion into the humanoid market withe H1 signals its intention to compete directly with leading robotics firms in creating the next generation of general-purpose robots.
