# Sanctuary AI

## Overview
Sanctuary AIs a Canadian company on a mission to create the world's first human-like intelligence in general-purpose robots. Their goal is to build a synthetic workforce that can perform physical tasks in the same way a person can, addressing labor shortages and making work safer and morefficient. Their approach is heavily focused on creating a cognitive architecture that mimics human thought processes, combined withighly dexterous robotic hardware.

## Company History & Milestones

## Key Robots & Technology

### Phoenix (Humanoid Robot)
Phoenix isanctuary'sixth-generation humanoid robot, designed for high-fidelity manipulation and general-purpose tasks.

- **Design**: Stands at 5' 7" and weighs 155 lbs, with a human-like form factor. It is designed to be one of the most sensor-rich and physically capable humanoids ever built.
- **Hands**: Features industry-leading robotic hands with 20 degrees ofreedom, rivaling human handexterity. This a key differentiator, enabling fine-motor tasks.
- **Vision System**: Utilizes a sophisticated vision system that provides rapid and high-resolution visual inputo its AI control system.

### Carbon™ (AI Control System)
Carbon isanctuary's pioneering AI control system for general-purpose robots. It is a cognitive architecture designed to translate natural language into action in the real world.

- **Approach**: Carbon combines modern AI technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) with a symbolic reasoning layer. This allows the robot to not only perform tasks but also to understand, reason about, and explain them.
- **Teleoperation & Simulation**: The system is trained using a combination of high-fidelity simulation and human-in-the-loop teleoperation, where human pilots control the robot to perform tasks, generating valuable training data.
- **'Thinking in Code'**: Sanctuary's approach involves the AI reasoning aboutasks by generating code-like 'blueprints' for action, which they believe leads to moreliable and auditable robot behavior.

## Core Technology & Approach

- **Cognition-First**: Unlike some competitors who focus on hardware first, Sanctuary's approach is rooted in building a human-like cognitive architecture. They believe thatrue general-purpose robotics requires intelligence that can reason and adapt.
- **Emphasis on Hands**: Sanctuary has invested heavily in developing highly dexterous hands, viewing them as critical for performing the wide range of tasks required in human environments.
- **Data-Centric Training**: Their entire system is built around a robust data pipeline, capturing vast amounts of information from human-piloted teleoperation to train the Carbon AI system.
- **Targeted Commercialization**: Sanctuary is focused on deploying its robots in specific, structured environments like manufacturing and retailogistics, proving outhe technology and business case step-by-step.

## Impact and Future Direction
Sanctuary AIs a significant player in the race to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) embodied in a physical form. Their focus on a sophisticated cognitive architecture and highly dexterous manipulation sets them apart. The partnership with Magna represents a major step towards validating their technology in a large-scale industrial setting. Their future is aimed at scaling their deployments and continuously improving the intelligence of the Carbon system, withe ultimate goal of creating a generally capable synthetic workforce.
