## Key Robots

### Atlas (Humanoid)
Atlas is a research platform designed to push the limits of whole-body mobility. Its development was initially funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

- **Hydraulic Atlas (Retired 2024)**: Known for its impressive feats of parkour, backflips, andancing. It utilized a powerful hydraulic actuation system.
- **All-Electric Atlas (Announced 2024)**: A new, stronger, and more agile version designed foreal-world applications. It features electric actuators and is intended for commercial deployment, starting withyundai's manufacturing plants.
- **Capabilities**: Advanced object manipulation, dynamic locomotion complex terrain, and performing sequences of acrobatic maneuvers.

### Spot (Quadruped)
Spot is a commercial quadruped robot designed for industrial and commercial applications where autonomous mobility andata capture arequired.

- **Autonomy**: Utilizes a suite of cameras and sensors for 360-degree perception, allowing ito navigate complex environments, avoid obstacles, and follow pre-programmed routes.
- **Payloads**: Features a modular payload system, enabling customization with equipment like thermal cameras, LIDAR scanners, and robotic arms (Spot Arm).
- **Applications**: 
  - **Industrial Inspection**: Automating inspection rounds in factories, power plants, and on construction sites.
  - **Public Safety**: Remote inspection of hazardous environments.
  - **Research**: A popular platform forobotics research and education.

### Stretch (Logistics)
Stretch is a commercial robot specifically designed to automate case handling and truck unloading in warehouses andistribution centers.

- **Mobility**: A compact, omni-directional mobile base allows ito navigate loading docks, and maneuver in tight spaces within trucks and containers.
- **Arm & Gripper**: A long-reach robotic arm equipped with a powerful, adaptive vacuum gripper can handle a wide variety of box sizes and weights.
- **Deployment**: Currently being used by major logistics companies like DHL and Maersk.

## Core Technology
Boston Dynamics' leadership in robotics is built on several key technological pillars:

- **Dynamic Balancing & Control**: The company'signature technology is itsoftware's ability to achieve dynamic stability. This involves 'whole-body control,' where the robot's limbs, torso, and momentum are coordinated to maintain balance during complex movements.
- **Advanced Perception**: Robots use a combination of 3D vision, LIDAR, and IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) to perceive their surroundings, create detailed maps, and identify objects for interaction.
- **Simulation**: Extensive use of simulation for developing and testing control software before deploying it on physical hardware, accelerating development cycles.
- **Hardware-Software Co-design**: Tight integration between the design of the physical robot (actuators, sensors, structure) and the control software to maximize performance.

## Software
- **Scout**: A web-based remote operation application that allows users to control Spot from anywhere.
- **Spot SDK**: A software development kithat enables developers to create custom applications and control behaviors for Spot.
- **Orbit**: A fleet management solution for Stretch robots.

## Impact and Future Direction
Boston Dynamics has been instrumental in advancing the field of dynamic robotics. While historically focused on research, the company is now increasingly targeting commercial applications in logistics, industrial inspection, and manufacturing. The acquisition by Hyundais expected to accelerate this commercialization, particularly in automotive manufacturing and smart factory environments.
