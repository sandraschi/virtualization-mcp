# Agility Robotics

## Overview
Agility Robotics is a pioneering American robotics company focused on developing bipedal, legged robots designed toperate in human-centric environments. Their core mission is to build a robotic workforce that can handle dull, dirty, andangerous jobs, particularly in the logistics and supply chain sectors. Unlike many robotic solutions that require significant infrastructure changes, Agility's robots are builto navigate the world as it is, walking up stairs, over curbs, and through spaces designed for people.

## Robot Evolution

### Cassie (2017-2019)
Cassie was the foundational research platform that established Agility's expertise in bipedalocomotion. It was essentially a pair of bird-like legs without a torsor arms.
- **Design**: Inspired by the legs of ground-running birds, it was highly efficient andynamically stable.
- **Achievements**: Cassie was the first robot to learn to run using reinforcement learning and famously completed a 5K run in 2021 on a single battery charge.
- **Legacy**: Itsuccess in dynamic balancing and locomotion paved the way for a more functional, human-centric robot.

### Digit (2019-Present)
Digit is Agility's commercial product, evolving from the Cassie platform by adding a torso, arms, and a sensor head. It is designed specifically for logistics and warehouse tasks.
- **Form Factor**: Human-sized and human-shaped, allowing ito use the same tools and navigate the same spaces as human workers.
- **Payload Capacity**: Can lift and carry packages up to 16 kg (35 lbs).
- **Mobility**: Can walk forward, backward, sideways, turn in place, and crouch. It is capable of climbing stairs and traversing uneven terrain.
- **Manipulation**: The arms are used for lifting packages and for balance, much like a human uses their arms to stabilize themselves.

## Core Technology
Agility's approach is centered on creating robots that are practical and useful in existing infrastructure.
- **Bipedalocomotion**: The core innovation is in creating dynamically stable walking that is both robust and energy-efficient. This allows the robot toperate for long periods and navigate complex environments.
- **Human-Centric Design**: Thentire philosophy is to make the robot a drop-in solution for existing workflows. It doesn't require a warehouse to be rebuilt; it learns to work within thexisting human environment.
- **Autonomy & Fleet Management**: Digit operates autonomously to carry outasks like moving totes or packages from one pointo another. Agility provides a cloud-based platform for fleet management, task assignment, and troubleshooting.
- **Safety**: The robot is designed to be lightweight and operate safely alongside human workers.

## Partnerships and Commercialization
Agility Robotics has moved aggressively from research to commercial deployment.
- **Ford Motor Company**: In an early partnership, Ford explored using Digit for last-mile package delivery, where a robot could ride in an autonomous delivery vehicle and carry packages to a customer's doorstep.
- **Amazon**: A major investor and partner, Amazon is testing Digit in its warehouse and fulfillment centers for tasks like tote recycling. This partnership is a significant validation of Agility's approach for large-scale logistics.

## Use Cases & Future Outlook
Agility is focused on the 'middle mile' of logistics—the repetitive, physically demanding work inside warehouses andistribution centers.
- **Current Use Case**: Bulk material handling, such as moving totes and packages from shelves to conveyor belts or from one part of a facility to another.
- **Future Vision**: To create a general-purpose robot for labor-intensive jobs, freeing up human workers for more creative, cognitive, and customer-facing tasks. The long-term vision includes applications in retail, healthcare, andisasteresponse.
