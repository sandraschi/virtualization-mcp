## A Legacy of Breakthroughs: Two Pillars of AInnovation
Google DeepMind stands on the shoulders of twof the most influential research groups in AI history.

### From the Google Brain Team
The original Google Brain team was renowned for its work on large-scale deep learning and for creating technologies that now power countless AI systems worldwide.
- **Transformers (2017)**: The seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need" introduced the Transformer architecture, whichas become the foundational building block for nearly all modern large language models, includingPT and Gemini.
- **TensorFlow**: A powerful, open-source platform for machine learning that democratized access to deep learning and became a global standard.
- **BERT & LaMDA**: Foundationalanguage models that revolutionized natural language understanding and conversational AI, respectively.

### From DeepMind
Prior to the merger, DeepMind was celebrated for its "moonshot" projects that solved grand challenges in science and gaming, demonstrating the potential of AGI.
- **AlphaGo (2016)**: The first AI to defeat a world champion Go player, a landmark achievementhat showcased AI's capacity for strategy and intuition.
- **AlphaFold (2020)**: A revolutionary AI system that solved the 50-year-old grand challenge of protein structure prediction, dramatically accelerating biological and medical research. Its database is now used by over a million scientists.
- **WaveNet**: A deep generative model foraw audio that produced significantly more natural-sounding human speech, now used in Google Assistant.

## The Gemini Era: A Natively Multimodal Future
Geminis Google DeepMind's flagship model family and the firsto be developed by the combined entity. It was designed from the ground up to be **natively multimodal**, meaning it can seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine differentypes of information, including text, code, audio, images, and video.
- **Gemini 1.0 & 1.5 Pro**: A highly capable family of models offering different sizes (Ultra, Pro, Nano) optimized for various tasks, from complex reasoning ton-device deployment.
- **Core Capabilities**: Advanced reasoning, state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, and a focus on safety and responsibility.

## Core Technologies & Frameworks
- **JAX**: A high-performance machine learning framework for Python, favored for its autograd and XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler, widely used in the research community.
- **TensorFlow**: The robust, scalable, and production-ready ML platform that continues to be a cornerstone of Google's AI ecosystem.

## AI for Science & Society
A core part of Google DeepMind's mission is to apply AI to solve major scientific and societal challenges.
- **Biology**: Extending the success of AlphaFold tother areas like genomics andrug discovery.
- **Health**: Developing AI for medical imaging analysis andisease detection.
- **Climate & Sustainability**: Using AI to model complex environmental systems and optimizenergy consumption.
