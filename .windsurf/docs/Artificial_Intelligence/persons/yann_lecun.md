# Yann LeCun (1960-Present)

## Overview
Yann LeCun is a French-American computer scientist working primarily in machine learning, computer vision, mobile robotics, and computational neuroscience. He is one of the founding fathers of [convolutional neural networks (CNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) and has made significant contributions to deep learning. He currently serves as VP & Chief AI Scientist at Meta (formerly Facebook) and is a Silver Professor at New York University.
