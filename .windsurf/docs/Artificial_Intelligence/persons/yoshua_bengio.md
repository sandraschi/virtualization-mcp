# Yoshua Bengio (1964-Present)

## Overview
Yoshua Bengio is a Canadian computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks andeep learning. He is a professor athe University of Montreal and the scientific director of Mila (Quebec AInstitute). Bengio, along with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, is considered one of the pioneers of deep learning, for which they were awarded the 2018 Turing Award.
