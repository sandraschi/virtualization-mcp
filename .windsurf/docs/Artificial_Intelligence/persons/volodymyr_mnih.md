# Volodymyr Mnih (1985-Present)

## Overview
Volodymyr Mnih is a Ukrainian-Canadian computer scientist and research scientist at DeepMind, best known for his work on deep reinforcement learning, particularly the development of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. His researchas been instrumental in combining deep learning with reinforcement learning, enabling AI systems to learn complex behaviors directly from high-dimensional sensory input.

## Biography
Born in Ukraine, Mnih earned his BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Toronto and his PhD in Machine Learning from the University of Toronto under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton. After completing his PhD, he joinedeepMind, where he has been a key contributor to several groundbreaking AI projects. His work on DQN demonstrated that deep reinforcement learning could achieve human-level performance on a wide range of Atari 2600 games.
