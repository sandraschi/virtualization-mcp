# Alex Graves (1981-Present)

## Overview
Alex Graves is a British computer scientist and research scientist at DeepMind, specializing in deep learning, particularly in the areas of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), sequence prediction, and reinforcement learning. He is best known for his work on long short-termemory (LSTM) networks, connectionistemporal classification (CTC), and neural Turing machines (NTMs). Graves' researchas had a significant impact on speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and sequence modeling.

## Biography
Born in the United Kingdom, Graves earned his BA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge and his PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton. After completing his PhD, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at IDSIA in Switzerland under JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber before joining DeepMind in 2014. His thesis on "Supervised Sequence Labelling with Recurrent Neural Networks" is considered a foundational text in the field.
