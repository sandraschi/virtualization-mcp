# Geoffrey Hinton (1947-Present)

## Overview
Geoffrey Everest Hinton is a British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks. He is one of the most influential figures in the development of deep learning and neural networks, co-recipient of the 2018 Turing Award (often called the "Nobel Prize of Computing") with Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio.

## Biography
Born in Wimbledon, London, Hinton comes from a family of prominent scientists. He studied experimental psychology athe University of Cambridge and received his PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh in 1978. After working at various institutions, he joined the University of Toronto in 1987. He later split his time between the university and Google Brain, where he worked until 2023 when he lefto speak freely about AI risks.
