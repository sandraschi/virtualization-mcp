# A Short History of Artificial Intelligence

## The Early Years (1940s-1950s)
- **1943**: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts propose the first mathematical model of a neural network
- **1950**: Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," introducing the Turing Test
- **1956**: The term "Artificial Intelligence" is coined at the Dartmouth Conference, organized by John McCarthy
- **1957**: Frank Rosenblatt develops the Perceptron, an early neural network

## The First AI Winter (1974-1980)
- **1966**: The ALPAC report criticizes machine translation progress, leading to reduced funding
- **1969**: The Perceptron book by Minsky and Papert highlights limitations of neural networks
- **1973**: The Lighthill Report questions AI research progress, leading to funding cuts (UK's "AI Winter")
- **1980**: Expert systems gain popularity with the rise of the XCON system at Digital Equipment Corporation

## The Boom of Expert Systems (1980-1987)
- **1980s**: Rise of rule-based expert systems in business applications
- **1986**: Backpropagation algorithm popularized by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams
- **1987**: Lisp Machine market collapses, leading to the second AI winter

## The Rise of Machine Learning (1990s-2000s)
- **1995**: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) gain popularity
- **1997**: IBM's Deep Blue defeats chess champion Garry Kasparov
- **2006**: The term "Deep Learning" is coined by Geoffrey Hinton
- **2009**: ImageNet dataset is released, enabling breakthroughs in computer vision

## The Deep Learning Revolution (2010-Present)
- **2012**: AlexNet wins ImageNet competition, marking the start of deep learning dominance
- **2014**: GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are introduced by Ian Goodfellow
- **2017**: The Transformer architecture is introduced in "Attention Is All You Need"
- **2018**: GPT and BERT models demonstrate the power of large language models
- **2020**: GPT-3 shows remarkable few-shot learning capabilities
- **2022-2023**: ChatGPT and other large language models achieve widespread adoption
