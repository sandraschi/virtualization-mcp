# VirtualDJ: The Universal DJ Software

## What is VirtualDJ?

VirtualDJ is a feature-packed software application used by DJs to replace their traditional turntables and CD players, and use digital music instead of vinyl and CDs. For over two decades, it has been a dominant force in the digital DJing world, known for its accessibility to beginners and its powerful features that satisfy professional DJs. It allows users to mix audio tracks, video clips, and karaoke files in real-time, using either a mouse and keyboard or, more commonly, a dedicated hardware DJ controller.
