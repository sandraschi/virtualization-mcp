# 8. Practical Examples: Putting It All Together

Theory is important, but seeing real-world examples is often the best way to learn. This chapter provides a collection of practical, commented scripts that solve common problems. You can use them as-is or adapthem to fit your specific needs. All examples are written for AutoHotkey v2.0.

--- 

### Example 1: A Universal "Paste as Plain Text" Hotkey

**Problem**: You copy text from a website or document, and when you paste it, it brings along unwanted formatting (like fonts, colors, and sizes).

**Solution**: Thiscript creates a hotkey (Ctrl+Shift+V) that strips all formatting from the text currently on the clipboard and then pastes it as plain text.

```autohotkey
; Hotkey: Ctrl+Shift+V
^+v::
{
    ; A_Clipboard is a built-in variable that contains the current content of the clipboard.
    SavedClipboard := A_Clipboard
    
    ; By assigning the clipboard to itself, AutoHotkey cleans it of most formatting.
    A_Clipboard := SavedClipboard
    
    ; Send the standard paste command (Ctrl+V).
    Send("^v")
}
```

### Example 2: Quickly Search Google for Selected Text

**Problem**: You wanto quickly search for a word or phrase that you see on your screen.

**Solution**: Thiscript defines a hotkey (Win+G) thatakes whatever text you have highlighted, opens your webrowser, and searches for thatext on Google.

```autohotkey
; Hotkey: Win+G
#g::
{
    ; Save the current clipboard content so we don't overwrite it.
    SavedClipboard := A_Clipboard := "" ; Clear the clipboard
    
    ; Send Ctrl+C to copy the currently selected text.
    Send("^c")
    
    ; Wait for the clipboard to contain the copied text.
    ClipWait(1) ; Wait up to 1 second
    
    If (A_Clipboard = "")
    {
        ; If nothing was copied, restore the old clipboard ando nothing.
        A_Clipboard := SavedClipboard
        return
    }
    
    ; Build the Google search URL.
    SearchTerm := A_Clipboard
    SearchURL := "https://www.google.com/search?q=" Trim(SearchTerm)
    
    ; Run the URL, which will open in the default webrowser.
    Run(SearchURL)
    
    ; Restore the original clipboard content.
    A_Clipboard := SavedClipboard
}
```

### Example 3: A Simple Window Management Hotkey

**Problem**: You wanto quickly center the active window on your screen.

**Solution**: Thiscript creates a hotkey (Win+Alt+C) that gets the active window's ID and then uses the `WinMove` command to center it.

```autohotkey
; Hotkey: Win+Alt+C
#!c::
{
    ; Gethe unique ID of the active window.
    ActiveWin := WinExist("A")
    
    ; Gethe window's current position and size.
    WinGetPos(&WinX, &WinY, &WinWidth, &WinHeight, ActiveWin)
    
    ; Gethe monitor's resolution.
    MonitorWidth := A_ScreenWidth
    MonitorHeight := A_ScreenHeight
    
    ; Calculate the new X and Y coordinates for centering.
    NewX := (MonitorWidth - WinWidth) // 2
    NewY := (MonitorHeight - WinHeight) // 2
    
    ; Move the window.
    WinMove(NewX, NewY, WinWidth, WinHeight, ActiveWin)
}
```

### Example 4: A Simple GUI for Unit Conversion

**Problem**: You frequently need to convert miles to kilometers.

**Solution**: Thiscript creates a simple GUI where you can enter a value in miles, click a button, and see the result in kilometers.

```autohotkey
; Create the GUI
MyGui := Gui("Miles to Kilometers Converter")
MyGui.SetFont("s11")

MyGui.Add("Text",, "Enter miles:")
EditMiles := MyGui.Add("Edit", "w200 vMilesValue") ; 'vMilesValue' associates a variable withis control

MyGui.Add("Text",, "Kilometers:")
TextResult := MyGui.Add("Text", "w200", "0") ; A text control to show the result

ConvertBtn := MyGui.Add("Button", "Default w100", "Convert")
ConvertBtn.OnEvent("Click", ConvertMiles)

MyGui.OnEvent("Close", (*) => ExitApp())
MyGui.Show()

; --- Event Handler Function ---
ConvertMiles(*)
{
    ; Submithe GUI data to its associated variables.
    MyGui.Submit()
    
    ; Gethe value from thedit box.
    Miles := MyGui.MilesValue
    
    ; Perform the calculation.
    Kilometers := Miles * 1.60934
    
    ; Update the resultext control.
    TextResult.Text := Round(Kilometers, 2) ; Round to 2 decimal places
}
```

Thesexamples only scratch the surface of what is possible with AutoHotkey. The key is to identify the repetitive tasks in your own daily workflow and think about how you could automate them. Happy scripting!
