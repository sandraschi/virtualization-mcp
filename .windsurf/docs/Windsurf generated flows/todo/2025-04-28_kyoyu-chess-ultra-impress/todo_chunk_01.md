## 1. Assess Current State & Set Clear Goals
- Review all major features: gameplay, UI/UX, multiplayer, AI, documentation, andeployment.
- Define "perfect" for each stakeholder:
  - Kid brother: fun, easy to use, cool features, no bugs.
  - Venture capital: scalability, polish, innovation, business case, demo readiness.
- Make a checklist of "must-fix" bugs and "must-have" features.

## 2. Stabilize Core Functionality
- Fix all critical bugs (see bug flow for prioritized list).
- Add extensive logging and error catching throughouthe codebase (per project rule).
- Write and run automated tests for all core features (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- Ensure all build scripts andeployment processes work cleanly on Windows (see `windows-build-cleanup.md`).

## 3. Polish the User Experience
- Refine the UI: responsive design, clear navigation, beautiful visuals.
- Add tooltips, onboarding, and in-app help for new users.
- Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, color contrast, screen reader support).
- Add animations or visual effects that "wow" demo viewers.

## 4. Multiplayer & Collaboration
- Test multiplayer modes thoroughly (local & networked).
- Add clear error messages and recovery for connection issues.
- Log all multiplayer events for debugging and analytics.
- Consider adding a "spectator" or "coach" mode for demos.

## 5. AI & Game Logic
- Ensure AIs challenging but fair; allow difficulty adjustment.
- Log all AI decisions for transparency andebugging.
- Add a "hint" or "explain move" feature for educational value.

## 6. Dazzling Demo Prep
- Script a demo that shows off unique features, stability, and polish.
- Prepare sample games, highlight fun/innovative aspects.
- Add a "demode" that cycles through features automatically.
- Record a screencast as backup in case of live demo issues.

## 7. Documentation & Onboarding
- Update README and all user/developer docs (see agentic_coding & tag rulebook).
- Add quickstart guides, FAQ, and troubleshooting sections.
- Document provenance for all code lifted from otherepos (per project rule).

## 8. Deployment & Scalability
- Test deployment on all target platforms (Windows, web, etc.).
- Add logging for deployment errors and user activity.
- Set up monitoring/alerts for production issues.
- Prepare for scaling: statelesservers, cloud readiness if needed.

## 9. Business & Pitch Readiness
- Prepare a short pitch deck: vision, features, tech stack, business case.
- Gather testimonials or user feedback (kid brother can help!).
- Highlight what makes kyoyu-chess_ultra unique and scalable.

## 10. Self-Care & Sustainability
- Schedule breaks, avoid marathon coding benders (see bug flow for health tips).
- Log hours, breaks, and incidents for continuous improvement.
- Celebrate milestones with your team/family!

**Next Steps:**
- Break down each section above into actionable sub-tasks.
- Use the TODO flow to track progress and assign priorities.
- Review and update this plan weekly as you make progress.
