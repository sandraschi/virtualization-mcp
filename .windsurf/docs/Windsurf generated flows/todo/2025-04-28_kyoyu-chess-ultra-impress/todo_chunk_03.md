## 1. Codebase Audit
- Conduct a comprehensive code review: modularity, readability, test coverage, security, and code provenance (per project rule).
- Identify all major bugs, technical debt, and areas lacking logging or error catching.
- Benchmark performance using synthetic and real-world scenarios.

## 2. Build & Deployment Pipeline Review
- Map outhentire CI/CD process. Identify bottlenecks, failure points, and opportunities for automation.
- Ensureproducibility across all supported platforms (Windows, web, etc.).
- Validate that build artifacts are clean, versioned, and properly logged.

## 3. Infrastructure & Scalability Assessment
- Review server architecture, hosting, and cloud readiness.
- Stress-test multiplayer and AI components under load.
- Document monitoring, alerting, and rollback procedures.

## 4. Remediation Plan
- Prioritize fixes by impact and effort. Assign owners andeadlines.
- Implement missing logging and error handling (per project rule).
- Track remediation progress in the TODO flow and report weekly.
