- **Kodi** ([kodi.tv](https://kodi.tv/)) — Extremely flexible media center, can act as a Plex frontend with plugins, or as a standalone server.
- **Universal Media Server** ([universalmediaserver.com](https://www.universalmediaserver.com/)) — DLNA/UPnP-based, less feature-rich but highly compatible.
- **Stremio** ([stremio.com](https://www.stremio.com/)) — Focused on streaming and add-ons, not a full Plex replacement but a strong frontend for many sources.
- **MediaPortal** ([team-mediaportal.com](https://www.team-mediaportal.com/)) — Windows-centric, open source, TV andVR features.
