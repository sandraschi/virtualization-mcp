# Improvements and Limitations of the New Version of GitHub Copilot (2025)

## 1. Introduction
This research explores the improvements and limitations of the latest version of GitHub Copilot, with a particular focus on how it compares tother agentic AIDEs, such as Windsurf. The goal is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date, and unbiased overview for technical decision-makers andevelopers considering advanced AI coding assistants.

## 2. Improvements in the New Version of GitHub Copilot

### a. Enhanced Context Awareness
- The new Copilot leverages larger context windows, allowing ito consider more of the surrounding code and project structure.
- Improved ability to infer developer intent from comments and code patterns.

### b. Better Integration with IDEs
- Deep integration with Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim.
- Real-time code suggestions, inline completions, and multi-line code generation.
- Enhanced support forefactoring, code navigation, andocumentation generation.

### c. AI Model Upgrades
- Uses the latest OpenAI Codex and potentially GPT-4-class models, improving code generation quality and language support.
- Improved handling of edge cases, rare APIs, and less common programming languages.

### d. Security and Compliance
- Improved filtering of insecure code suggestions.
- Enhanced support for code provenance, licensing checks, and enterprise compliance.

### e. Collaboration Features
- Early versions of Copilot Chat and Copilot Workspace for collaborative coding, debugging, and code review.

## 3. Limitations of the New GitHub Copilot

### a. Lack ofull Agentic Autonomy
- Copilot remains primarily a code completion and suggestion tool, not a fully agentic system.
- Cannot autonomously plan, execute, and verify complex multi-step tasks orefactorings.

### b. Limited Workflow Automation
- No built-in support for automated multi-file refactoring, dependency management, or test orchestration.
- Lacks persistent memory or project-wide reasoning.

### c. Dependency on Cloud and Privacy Concerns
- Requires continuous cloud connectivity for best performance.
- Raises concerns for sensitive codebases regarding data privacy and intellectual property.

### d. Limited Customization and Extensibility
- Few options for user-defined workflows, custom agents, or deep integration with CI/CD pipelines.

## 4. Comparison with Agentic AIDEs (e.g., Windsurf)

### a. Agenticapabilities
- **Windsurf** and similar agentic IDEs can autonomously plan, execute, and verify entire coding tasks, not just suggest code.
- Support for multi-step task management, debugging, and errorecovery.

### b. Memory and Project Context
- Agentic IDEs maintain persistent memory of project state, past actions, and user preferences.
- Copilot has limited or no persistent memory acrossessions.

### c. Automation and Orchestration
- Agentic IDEs can run scripts, tests, and builds, and can reason about theiresults.
- Copilot cannot initiate or manage such workflows autonomously.

### d. Extensibility and Customization
- Agentic IDEs allow for custom rules, workflows, and integration with external tools.
- Copilot’s customization is limited to prompt engineering and minor settings.
