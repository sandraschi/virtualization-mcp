# Improvements and Limitations of the New Version of GitHub Copilot (2025)

## 5. Additional Considerations

### a. Ecosystem and Community
- GitHub Copilot benefits from a massive user base, frequent updates, andirect integration withe GitHub platform.
- Agentic IDEs like Windsurf, while powerful, may have a smaller community but often offer deeper customization for advanced users and teams.

### b. Pricing and Accessibility
- Copilot is a paid subscription service, with discounts for students and open-source contributors.
- Some agentic IDEs may be open source, enterprise-licensed, or have tiered pricing models.

### c. User Experience
- Copilot emphasizeseamless, non-intrusive suggestions, aiming to augment rather than automate.
- Agentic IDEs may require more onboarding but provide more control and automation for power users.
