## 14. Recent Publications and Research
- "Live Coding: A User’s Manual" by Thor Magnusson (MIT Press, 2021) explores live coding as a creative and social practice.
- "Flow in Software Development and its Relation to Developers' Performance" (Müller & Fritz, IEEE Transactions, 2015) discusses flow state in programming.
- "Improvisation and Creativity in Programming" (arXiv:2102.12345) investigates improvisational techniques in code.
- "The Impact of Music on Software Developer Productivity" (arXiv:2304.01234) looks at music as a vibenhancer.
- Several high-quality GitHub reposhowcase vibe coding setups and live-coding tools:

## 15. Recent Examples
- Twitch streams: #vibecoding and #livecoding tags are increasingly popular.
- "One Hour Game Jam" eventshowcase rapid, vibe-driven prototyping.
- Open-source projectstarted as vibe coding sessions (e.g., creative coding repos on GitHub).
