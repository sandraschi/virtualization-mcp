# Agentic AI-Based Vibe Coding (Karpathy): Dangers, Risks, and Societal Impact

## 5. Dangers of Low-Quality and Shady Apps
- Thease of generating andeploying code with agentic AI can lead to an explosion of low-quality, insecure, or outright malicious applications.
- Automated agents may inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities, license violations, or privacy leaks.
- The barrier to entry for app development is drastically lowered, enabling both innovation and abuse.
- Examples: "AI spamware" apps, rapid cloning of existing products, and proliferation of scammy browser extensions or mobile apps.

## 6. Destruction of Developer Jobs?
- One major controversy is the potential for agentic AI to automate away many traditional developeroles, especially in routine coding, bug fixing, and boilerplate generation.
- Critics warn of job displacement, wage pressure, and the deskilling of the profession.
- Others argue that human creativity, judgment, and high-level design will remain essential, with AI agentserving as powerful amplifiers.

## 7. Political, Economic, and Legal Implications
- Political debate centers on regulation of AI-generated code, liability for bugs or exploits, and the future of tech employment.
- Economic impact: potential for massive productivity gains, but also market disruption and concentration of power among those withe best AI tools.
- Legal issues: copyright, code provenance, and accountability for AI-generated software.

## 8. Recent Controversies and Public Discourse
- High-profile incidents of AI-generated malware and scam apps have prompted calls for tighter oversight.
- Debates in developer communities (e.g., Hacker News, Twitter) over thethics and future of agenticoding.
- Ongoing research into AI alignment, explainability, and safety in autonomous code generation.
