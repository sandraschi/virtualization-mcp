## Comparison: Windsurf vs Other Agentic IDEs

  - Favors token-based agentic flows (e.g., `bug: ... :bug`, `research: ... :research`).
  - Encourages user-defined rulebooks in `docs/` and `docs/flows/`.
  - Session memory is not persistentâ€”users must reload rulebooks in each session.
- **Other Agentic IDEs:**
  - Some (e.g., MetaFlowIDE) allow persistent rulebook memory acrossessions.
  - Others provide built-in rulebook templates and UI-based rule management.
  - Some support hierarchical organization-wide meta-rulebooks natively.
