# Increasing Fungal Pathogens in Plants and Animals: Overview and Historical Cases

## 1. Introduction
Fungal pathogens are increasingly recognized as a major threato global biodiversity, agriculture, and ecosystem stability. This research flow examines the rise ofungal diseases in plants and animals, focusing on Dutch elm disease, white-nose syndrome in bats, and large-scale amphibian extinctions. We also discuss the role of insects as carriers and the recent ash die-off.

## 2. Dutch Elm Disease (DED)
- Caused by the fungi Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi.
- First appeared in Europe in thearly 20th century, later spreading to North America.
- Responsible for the death of millions of elm trees.
- **Mode of transmission:** Primarily spread by elm bark beetles (Scolytuspp.), which carry fungal spores from infected to healthy trees.
- **Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing, andeath of leaves and branches; eventual tree death.
- Management includesanitation (removal of infected wood), insect control, and breeding foresistance.

## 3. White-Nose Syndrome in Bats
- Caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans.
- First identified inorth America in 2006; hasince killed millions of bats.
- **Mode of transmission:** Direct contact between bats; spores can also be spread by humans and cave-dwelling insects.
- **Symptoms:** White fungal growth on muzzle and wings, disrupted hibernation, mass mortality events.
- Severecological consequences due to loss of insectivorous bats.

## 4. Amphibian Extinctions: Chytridiomycosis
- Caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal).
- First detected in the late 20th century; now found on every continent except Antarctica.
- **Mode of transmission:** Waterborne zoospores; can also be carried by amphibians, birds, and insects.
- **Symptoms:** Skin lesions, lethargy, death; has led to the decline or extinction of hundreds of amphibian species.
