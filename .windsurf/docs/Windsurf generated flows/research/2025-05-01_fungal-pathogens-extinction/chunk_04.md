# Fungal Pathogens: Recent Growth, Examples, Publications, and Bibliography

## 13. Recent Growth and Emerging Threats
- Fungal diseases in plants and animals have increased significantly in the 21st century.
- Globalization, climate change, and habitat disturbance acceleratemergence and spread.
- New pathogens are being identified at an unprecedented rate.
- Conservationists warn of a "fungal pandemic" risk for wildlife and crops.
