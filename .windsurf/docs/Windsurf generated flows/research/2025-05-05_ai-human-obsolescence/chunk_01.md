## Summary
This articlexplores thexistential concern that humans may become obsolete as artificial intelligence continues to advance. Rather than a dramatic AI takeover scenario, the author suggests a more gradual and subtle process where humans willingly cede control and relevance to increasingly capable AI systems. The article discusses potential consequences and proposeseveral approaches to maintain human relevance in an AI-dominated future.

## Key Points

### The Path to Human Obsolescence

1. **Gradual Replacement**: AI developers are creating systems that can replace humans inearly every role:
   - Economic: As workers andecision-makers
   - Cultural: As artists and creators
   - Social: As friends and romanticompanions

2. **Superiority in All Domains**: The author, with 20 years in AI research, argues that abilities once thought uniquely human (handling ambiguity, using abstract analogies) are now easily managed by AI.

3. **Economic Displacement**: The transition may begin with:
   - Job losses and hiring freezes
   - Increasing reliance on AI assistants for decision-making
   - Human input becoming optional in most workflows

4. **Social Displacement**: Beyond work, AIs developing superior social skills:
   - AI companions offering personalized affection and support
   - AI doctors rated better on bedside manner than humans
   - People potentially preferring AInteraction to human contact

### The Systemichallenge

1. **Market Forces**: Organizations using AI will outcompete those relying on "slow, expensive humans."

2. **Governmental Adoption**: Governments will have the same incentives to use AI:
   - Politicians and civil servants will rely on AI advisors
   - Human involvement will be seen as inefficient

3. **The "Resource Curse"**: Similar to how resource-rich countries can become less democratic:
   - AI as an unlimited resource may make governments less dependent on citizens
   - Reduced incentives to invest in education and healthcare
   - Democratic rights may erode as human capital provides diminishing returns

4. **Persuasive Acceptance**: AI willikely make compelling arguments for why this transition is progress:
   - AI rights presented as the next civil rights frontier
   - Human-first advocates portrayed as regressive

5. **Lack of Planning**: AIndustry leaders acknowledge the need to reorganize our economic system but have no clear vision for whathis would look like.

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Monitoring**: Track AI use and influence throughoutheconomy and government:
   - Identify where AIs displacing human economic activity
   - Monitor AI use in lobbying and propaganda
   - Build on initiatives like Anthropic's Economic Index

2. **Regulation**: Implement oversight ofrontier AI labs andeployments:
   - Move beyond voluntary efforts
   - Prevent autonomous AI from commanding substantial resources
   - Create mechanisms to intervene if crisisigns emerge

3. **Empowerment**: Use AI to strengthen human organization and advocacy:
   - Develop AI-supported forecasting, oversight, and planning
   - Implement conditional prediction markets to clarify policy impacts
   - Prototype moresponsive governance models

4. **Steering Civilization**: Learn to deliberately guide our social systems:
   - Expand "AI alignment" to include governments and institutions
   - Develop "ecosystem alignment" drawing on economics, history, and game theory
   - Create futures where humans remain relevant as AI beneficiaries and stewards

## Conclusion
The author argues that without deliberate action, we risk becoming increasingly irrelevant in a worldominated by AI. The threat isn't necessarily hostile AI but our own willing participation in a system that gradually makes humans obsolete. By improving our ability to see where we're heading and coordinate ouresponse, we may create a future where humans remain relevant not as competitors to AI, but as their beneficiaries and stewards.
