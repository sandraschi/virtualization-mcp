# Section 1: Deep Dive into Microsoft AI Toolkit for VS Code

## Overview

The **Microsoft AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code** is a powerful extension designed to streamline the development, testing, andeployment of generative AI models and agents directly within the VS Codenvironment. It is a comprehensive toolset for AI engineers, data scientists, and app developers who wanto leverage both public and custom AI models, build agentic workflows, andeploy intelligent applications.

## Key Features

- **Model Catalog**: Browse, download, and run models from providersuch as OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, HuggingFace, ONNX, and Ollama. Supports both cloud and local models.
- **Playground**: Experiment with prompts and models, test prompt quality, and compare outputs across different models.
- **Agent Builder**: Create, iterate, and chain prompts to build complex AI agents. Integrate with external tools and APIs via MCP (Model Control Protocol).
- **Bulk Run & Evaluation**: Run prompts in batch mode, evaluate model outputs against datasets, and fine-tune models for specific tasks.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Customize models for your particular use case, including dataset-driven evaluation and optimization.
- **Multi-modal and Multi-platform**: Supports text, image, and multi-modal models; compatible with Windows 11 (DirectML, CPU), WSL, and more.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with VS Codeâ€™s debugging, version control, and extension ecosystem.
- **Telemetry & Privacy**: Collects usage data for improvement (can be disabled).

## Typical Workflow

1. **Model Discovery**: Use the Catalog to find andownload models.
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Use the Playground to author and refine prompts.
3. **Agent Construction**: Chain prompts and integrate tools using the Agent Builder.
4. **Testing & Evaluation**: Use Bulk Run and Evaluation tools to validate performance.
5. **Fine-Tuning**: Adjust models for your dataset and requirements.
6. **Deployment**: Integrate agents into applications or deploy to the cloud.
