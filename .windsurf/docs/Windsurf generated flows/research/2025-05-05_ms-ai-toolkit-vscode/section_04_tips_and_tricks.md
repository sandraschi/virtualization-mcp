# Section 4: Tips and Tricks

- **Use the Playground forapid Prototyping**: Quickly iterate on prompts and compare outputs from different models before integrating into agents.
- **Leverage Bulk Run for Benchmarking**: Test prompt variations or model performance on large datasets efficiently.
- **Agent Builder for Complex Workflows**: Chain prompts and integrate with APIs or databases using MCP for advanced agentic flows.
- **Local Model Execution**: Use ONNX or Ollama to run models locally for privacy, speed, or offline use.
- **Debugging**: Use VS Code’s built-in debugger with your agents for step-by-step troubleshooting.
- **Fine-Tune Models**: Customize models for your domain using the toolkit’s fine-tuning capabilities.
- **Disable Telemetry**: Set `telemetry.enableTelemetry` to `false` in VS Code settings for privacy.
- **Stay Updated**: Follow the [AI Sparks webinar series](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-developer-community-blog/ai-sparks-ai-toolkit-for-vs-code-from-playground-to-production/ba-p/4375946) for advanced walkthroughs and new features.
