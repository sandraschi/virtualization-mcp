# Section 2: Competition

## Main Competitors

- **Windsurf (formerly Codeium)**: Focuses on code completion, in-editor chat, and code understanding for developers; less emphasis on agentic workflows or model evaluation.
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI code assistant, strong for code completion and chat, but does not provide agent building, model catalog, or prompt evaluation tools.
- **Hugging Facextension**: Allows running and testing Hugging Face models in VS Code, but lacks integrated agent builder and prompt chaining.
- **OpenAI API/Playground**: External to VS Code, used for prompt/model testing, but not as tightly integrated.
- **Other AI Extensions**: Many offer code completion or chat, but few provide full agentic workflow, model catalog, and evaluation tools in one package.

## Unique Selling Points of MS AI Toolkit

- **Agent Builder** with prompt chaining and tool integration (MCP).
- **Bulk prompt evaluation** andataset-driven testing.
- **Model fine-tuning** and local model support (ONNX, Ollama).
- **Multi-provider catalog** (OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, etc.).
- **Native integration** with Windows AI stack andirectML.
