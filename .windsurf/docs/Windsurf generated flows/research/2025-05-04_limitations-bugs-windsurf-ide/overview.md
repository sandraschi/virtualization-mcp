## Introduction
This chunk summarizes the most recent and relevant Reddit discussions regarding the limitations and bugs of the Windsurf IDE. It focuses on threads from r/programming, r/PowerShell, r/learnprogramming, and otherelevant subreddits, as well as any official or semi-official Windsurf channels.

## Methodology
