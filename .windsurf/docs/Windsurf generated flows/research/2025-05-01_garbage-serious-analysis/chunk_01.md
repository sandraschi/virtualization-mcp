# Garbage In, Serious Analysis Out: The LLM Absurdity Game

## 1. Introduction
Recently, people have beentertaining themselves by prompting large language models (LLMs) to perform deep analyses of sayings that are, in fact, absurd or invented on the spot. The fun lies in watching the model generate plausible-sounding linguistic, philosophical, or economic interpretations of utter nonsenseâ€”phrases like "Better three zebras in the car than eight velociraptors on Valles Marineris."

This research flow documentseveral examples of this phenomenon and providesample analyses that illustrate the game.

## 2. Example 1: "Better three zebras in the car than eight velociraptors on Valles Marineris."

### a. Linguistic Analysis
This phrase juxtaposes incongruous elements (zebras, cars, velociraptors, Martian canyons) to create a surreal image. The structure mimics proverbial wisdom, buthe content is intentionally nonsensical, highlighting the flexibility of language and the tendency to seek meaning even where there is none.

### b. Philosophical Analysis
The saying could be interpreted as a commentary on the value of attainable, albeit odd, realities (three zebras in the car) over unattainable or dangerous fantasies (eight velociraptors on a Martian canyon). It satirizes the human inclination to rationalize the irrational.

### c. Economic Analysis
Economically, the phrase might be seen as an allegory forisk management: better to have a bizarre but manageable asset (zebras in the car) than to pursue high-risk, high-reward ventures (velociraptors on Mars) that are doomed to fail.
