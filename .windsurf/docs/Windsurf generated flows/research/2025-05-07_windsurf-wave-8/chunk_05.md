research: Windsurf Cascade Session Loss â€“ User Experience and Impact :research

## The Problem: Session Loss and Its Impact
- **User Experience:** After a long session with a thousand-line Cascade, full of idea exchange, planning, and memorable conversations, everything can vanish if not explicitly saved or shared (and even then, only within the Teams/Enterprise context).
- **Emotional Impact:** This a major "vibekiller" for power users and creative teams. The inability to archive, export, orevisit long agentic sessions breaks the flow and can lead to loss of valuable insights, plans, and technical knowledge.
- **Lack of Portability:** Unlike traditional chat or IDE logs, there is no way to export or back up a full Cascade session for futureference, sharing outside the org, or personal archiving.
- **Summary:** The current design prioritizes internal collaboration but athe cost of user autonomy and long-term knowledge retention. Many users find this limitation deeply frustrating and a barrier to adopting Cascade for serious, creative, or strategic work.
