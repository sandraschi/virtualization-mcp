# Example: Batch Smart Editing with Magicut/Scene Detection

Thiscript uses DaVinci Resolveâ€™s Python API to automate scene detection (Magicut) across multiple clips, creating automated rough cuts.

```python
import DaVinciResolveScript as dvresolve = dvr.scriptapp('Resolve')
project = resolve.GetProjectManager().GetCurrentProject()
media_pool = project.GetMediaPool()
clips = media_pool.GetRootFolder().GetClips()

for clip_id, clip in clips.items():
    # Run scene detection (Magicut)
    # Note: Actual API call may differ; Magicut is often run via GUI, but scripting can trigger scene detection
    clip.DetectScenes()  # If supported
    # Optionally, addetected scenes to timeline
    scenes = clip.GetScenes()  # Get detected scenes
    for scene in scenes:
        media_pool.AppendToTimeline([scene])
```
*Scene detection API support may vary by Resolversion. For advanced use, combine with manual scripting and timelinedits.*
