## 1. Introduction

Digital collaboration has transformed the way research and software development are conducted. Withe rise of online chat, video conferencing, and collaborative platforms, teams can work together across continents. The next frontier is the integration of agentic AI—AI that not only participates in discussions but also has full, live access to the shared codebase oresearch project, providing real-time, context-aware insights.

## 2. Thevolution of Online Collaboration

- Early online forums and IRC for developer Q&A
- Rise of platforms like Slack, Microsofteams, Discord, and Zoom
- Collaborative coding (e.g., Google Colab, Visual Studio Live Share)
- Version control and shared repos (GitHub, GitLab)
- Emergence of AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Codeium)

## 3. Multi-User Chat with AI: Current State

- Most AI chatbots are single-user or "one-on-one" assistants
- Some platforms (Slack, Teams) allow bots to join group chats, but with limited context and repo awareness
- GitHub Copilot Chat canswerepo-specific questions, but not in true multi-user, multi-turn debates
- No mainstream solution yet allows deep, persistent, multi-human+AI debate with full repo/project access
