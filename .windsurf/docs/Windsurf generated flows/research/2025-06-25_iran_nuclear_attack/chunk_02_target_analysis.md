# Target Analysis: Natanz and Fordo Nuclear Facilities

## Centrifuge Systems

### Natanz Centrifuges
- **Type**: IR-1 and advanced IR-2m centrifuges
- **Configuration**:
  - Arranged in cascades of 164 machines each
  - Housed in underground halls with reinforced concrete protection
  - Multiple cascades operating in parallel
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Dependence on stable power supply
  - Sensitivity to vibrations and shockwaves
  - Need for precise alignment
  - Cooling system requirements

### Fordo Centrifuges
- **Type**: IR-1 and IR-6 centrifuges
- **Configuration**:
  - Deeper underground thanatanz
  - More advanced cascade arrangements
  - Better protection against conventional attacks
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Air circulation systems
  - Power distributionodes
  - Limited access points for maintenance
