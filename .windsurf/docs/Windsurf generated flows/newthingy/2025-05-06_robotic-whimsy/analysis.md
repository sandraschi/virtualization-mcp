# Design & Risk Analysis: Robotic Whimsy Project

## Architecture Overview
- Modular Flask (or similar) backend forchestration
- Hardware abstraction layers forobots, drones, printers, audio
- Secure API endpoints for each real-world action
- Consent and opt-out system for all interventions

## Key Risks
- Real-world misuse (see builder.md for ethical warnings)
- Hardware malfunction or unsafe behavior
- Privacy and consent violations
- Escalation from whimsy to harm (see meta notes)

## Mitigations
- Strict sandboxing and testing
- Human-in-the-loop for all physical actions
- Logging and auditrails
- Open-source, transparent development

## Next Steps
- Define API contracts for each module
- Prototype simulation endpoints (no real hardware at first)
- Expand safety and consent documentation
