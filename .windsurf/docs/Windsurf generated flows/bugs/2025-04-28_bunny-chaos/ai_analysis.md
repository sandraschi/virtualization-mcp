# AI Analysis: Bunny Chaos

**Timestamp:** 2025-04-28T20:13:48+02:00

## Analysis
- This appears to be a classicase of exponential bunny population growth, likely due to insufficient population controls or missing natural predators in the simulation.
- The carrot depletion suggests resource management logic is either missing or not strict enough.
- The "hopping all over the place" may indicate a bug in the movement algorithm or lack of spatial constraints.

## Resolution Suggestions
1. Implement bunny population contrologic (e.g., max population cap, breeding cooldowns, or introduce a fox).
2. Add resource regeneration or limit carrot consumption per bunny.
3. Review and constrain bunny movement logic to prevent chaotic hopping.
4. (Optional) Add a "carrot alarm" to notify when resources are low.
