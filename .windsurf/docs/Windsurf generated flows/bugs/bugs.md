**Usereport:**
The bunnies are hopping all over the place and making too many baby bunnies. Also they areating all the carrots.

**AI Analysis:**
- This appears to be a classicase of exponential bunny population growth, likely due to insufficient population controls or missing natural predators in the simulation.
- The carrot depletion suggests resource management logic is either missing or not strict enough.
- The "hopping all over the place" may indicate a bug in the movement algorithm or lack of spatial constraints.

**Resolution Suggestions:**
1. Implement bunny population contrologic (e.g., max population cap, breeding cooldowns, or introduce a fox).
2. Add resource regeneration or limit carrot consumption per bunny.
3. Review and constrain bunny movement logic to prevent chaotic hopping.
4. (Optional) Add a "carrot alarm" to notify when resources are low.
