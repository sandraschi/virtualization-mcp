# AI Analysis: Start Page Buttons Not Showing Matching Hubs (kyoyu-chess-ultra)

**Timestamp:** 2025-04-28T20:20:48+02:00

## Analysis
- This a repo-specific bug for kyoyu-chess-ultra. The start page buttons are supposed to display oroute to matching "hubs" (e.g., AllGamesHub, BoardGamesHub, ProjectsHub, etc.) but do not function as expected.
- The main logic for button-to-hub mapping is in `frontend/src/components/HubStartPage.tsx`. Each button uses an `onClick` handler (typically `handleNavigate`) to route to a hub.
- Potential causes in this repo:
  1. The button's `onClick` handler may not be correctly wired to the hub route (e.g., `/chess`, `/shogi`, `/japanesehub`).
  2. The route itself may be missing, misspelled, or not registered in your main router (React Router config).
  3. There may be a mismatch between the button label, the path, and the actual hub component name or export.
  4. Recent changes to hub naming or the "dashed-hubname-fiasco" may have broken the mapping.
  5. The hub component may fail to mount or throw an error, preventing rendering.

## Actionable Resolution Suggestions (kyoyu-chess-ultra)
1. **Check the `handleNavigate` logic in `HubStartPage.tsx`:**
   - Ensureach button's `onClick` points to the correct path and label for the intended hub.
   - Add logging inside `handleNavigate` to confirm the correct path/label is triggered.
2. **Audit yourouter configuration:**
   - In your main router (likely `App.tsx` or similar), verify that all hub routes (e.g., `/chess`, `/shogi`, `/japanesehub`, `/projects`) are present and pointo the correct components.
   - Look for any typos, missing routes, or mismatches between path and component.
3. **Review hub component exports:**
   - Ensureachub (e.g., `AllGamesHub.tsx`, `BoardGamesHub.tsx`, etc.) is exported as default and imported correctly in the router.
4. **Check for errors at runtime:**
   - Open the browser console and look for errors when clicking a button. Also check backend logs if relevant.
   - Use the `useLogger` hooks already present in the codebase for extensive logging.
5. **Test each button:**
   - Click each button and confirm the correct hub loads. If not, note which ones fail and what error (if any) appears.
6. **If you recently changed hub names oroutes:**
   - Compare the current route/component names to the pre-fiasco state (see `docs/development/dashed-hubname-fiasco.md`). Undor update mappings as needed.
7. **Write/expand tests:**
   - Add or update automated tests to cover button-to-hub navigation and rendering for all major hubs.

**Note:** If you want a step-by-step debug script, or wanto automate the audit, let Cascade know!
