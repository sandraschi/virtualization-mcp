# AI Analysis: Start Page Buttons Do Not Show Matching Hubs

**Timestamp:** 2025-04-28T20:18:31+02:00

## Analysis
- This bug suggests a disconnect between the button UI on the start page and the logic that determines whichubshould be displayed.
- Possible causes include:
  - Incorrect or missing event handlers on the buttons.
  - The mapping between buttons and hubs may be broken (e.g., mismatched IDs, names, oroutes).
  - The hub data may not be loaded or filtered correctly when a button is pressed.
  - There could be a frontend state management issue (e.g., React state, Vue data, etc.) or a backend API problem.
- If this a regression, check forecent changes to hub naming, routing, or button rendering logic (see "dashed-hubname-fiasco").

## Resolution Suggestions
1. Inspecthe button click handlers and ensure they trigger the correct logic to display hubs.
2. Verify the mapping between buttons and hubs (IDs, names, routes) is correct and consistent.
3. Add extensive logging to the button event logic and hub display code to catch errors or unexpected state.
4. Check for errors in the browser console and backend logs when a button is pressed.
5. Write or update automated tests to cover the button-to-hub mapping andisplay flow.
6. If recent refactors changed hub naming orouting, audithose changes for breakage.
