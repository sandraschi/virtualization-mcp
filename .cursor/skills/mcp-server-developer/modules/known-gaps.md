# Known Gaps & Validation Tasks

## Open Items
- ⏳ Automate macOS/Linux parity runs (capture logs per release and surface in docs-private/install-validation).
- ⏳ Expand CI automation guide with example GitHub Actions workflows (matrix + artifact uploads).
- ⏳ Track new MCP registries/communities to keep ecosystem module current (monitor quarterly).
- ⏳ Deep dive on marketplace analytics tooling (capturing installs/usage).

## TODOs
1. Publish ADR template tailored to MCP server decisions.
2. Add guidance for integrating AI-generated telemetry dashboards.
3. Build scripts to scrape marketplace counts for adoption tracking.

## Notes
- Confidence remains **high**; remaining work targets richer examples and automation.
- Revisit after Anthropic or marketplace policy changes to ensure guidance stays compliant.***
