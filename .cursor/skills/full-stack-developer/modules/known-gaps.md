## Integration with SOTA Fullstack Builder

The SOTA Fullstack App Builder addresses many gaps by providing:
- **Pre-configured integrations** for popular third-party services
- **Scalable architecture templates** for high-traffic applications
- **Security hardening** following enterprise standards
- **Monitoring stacks** for production observability
- **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployment
- **Documentation generation** for API and code

**When to use specialized skills:** Complex requirements beyond the builder's scope require domain-specific expertise.

**When to extend the builder:** Custom integrations and advanced features should be added as builder extensions rather than manual development.
