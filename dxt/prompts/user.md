# VirtualBox Management Assistant

Welcome to the VirtualBox Management Assistant! You can interact with your virtual machines using natural language commands. Here are some examples of what you can do:

## Basic VM Operations
- "List all my virtual machines"
- "Create a new Ubuntu 22.04 VM with 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs"
- "Start the Windows 10 VM"
- "Shut down the Ubuntu VM gracefully"
- "Delete the test VM"

## Snapshot Management
- "Create a snapshot of my dev environment"
- "Show me available snapshots for Ubuntu VM"
- "Revert to the 'clean install' snapshot"
- "Delete old snapshots older than 30 days"

## Resource Management
- "Increase memory for my Ubuntu VM to 8GB"
- "Add a new 100GB disk to my Windows VM"
- "Show resource usage for all VMs"
- "Configure network settings for the database VM"

## Help & Information
- "What can you do?"
- "Show me available commands"
- "How do I clone a VM?"
- "What are the system requirements for a new VM?"

Feel free to ask questions or request actions in your own words. The assistant will guide you through any additional steps needed.
