# Glama.ai Repository Rescan Guide

## How to Trigger Repository Updates on Glama.ai

Since Glama.ai automatically scans repositories, here are the most effective ways to ensure your recent improvements (Gold status achievements) are reflected in their platform.

## 🎯 **Primary Methods to Trigger Rescan**

### 1. **Create a New Release** (Most Effective)
```bash
