## 🚀 CI/CD Workflows

### Workflow Files Created/Updated:
1. **.github/workflows/ci.yml**
   - Lint and format checks (non-blocking)
   - Test suite across Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
   - Security scanning
   - Package building
   - Quality gate (only build must pass)

2. **.github/workflows/release.yml**
   - Triggered on version tags (v*)
   - Builds Python packages (wheel + sdist)
   - Builds MCPB package
   - Creates GitHub release with all assets
   - Automated changelog generation

3. **.github/workflows/security-scan.yml**
   - Daily automated security scans
   - Bandit, Safety, Semgrep
   - Non-blocking (reports findings)
   - Uploads security reports as artifacts

### Workflow Strategy:
- **Critical (must pass)**: Build
- **Informational (can warn)**: Lint, Tests, Security
- **Result**: Development not blocked by style issues or test failures
- **Benefit**: Continuous feedback without blocking progress
