## 🚀 THE EPIC WIN11 VM RECOVERY STORY

### The Challenge 💥
- Corrupted Windows 11 VM stuck in "aborted" state for 5 days
- Missing virtual disk files (VDI corruption)
- Boot failures and inaccessible media errors
- Complex VirtualBox configuration nightmare

### The Solution 🔧
**Used virtualization-mcp + PowerShell MCP integration to:**
1. **Diagnose** the problem through automated VM inspection
2. **Create** fresh 80GB virtual disk programmatically  
3. **Reconfigure** storage, boot order, and firmware settings
4. **Launch** Windows 11 installer successfully
5. **Deliver** working VM ready for setup - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!
