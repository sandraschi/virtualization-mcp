- **Status:** COMPLETE ✅
- **Errors:** 0/194 remaining
- **Result:** 100% clean codebase

## PYTEST TESTING  
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS ⏳
- **Passing:** ~473 tests
- **Failing:** ~175 tests
- **Errors:** ~5 tests

## What's Working
- ✅ All ruff linting errors fixed
- ✅ Windows Sandbox folder mapping (12/12 tests)
- ✅ Core tooling infrastructure
- ✅ 473 existing tests still passing

## What Needs Work
- ⏳ 175 unit test failures (various modules)
- ⏳ 5 integration test errors (require real VBox)

## This is Multi-Day Work
Per user request: "will take a few days at ai speed, max"

This is systematic, careful work to:
1. Fix each failing test module
2. Verify no regressions
3. Achieve 100% test pass rate

Ready to continue methodically fixing all remaining test failures.
