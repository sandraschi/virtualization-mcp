# Tool Registration Incident Report - 2025-08-25

## Summary
During the implementation of network tools, an incorrect tool registration approach was used that deviated from FastMCP standards, leading to tool registration failures and potential data loss.

## Timeline
- **2025-08-25 10:30 AM**: Added network tools with programmatic registration
- **2025-08-25 10:45 AM**: Tools failed to appear in MCP client
- **2025-08-25 11:00 AM**: Discovered FastMCP requires `@mcp.tool()` decorators

## Root Cause
1. **Non-standard Implementation**: Used programmatic registration instead of `@mcp.tool()` decorators
2. **Missing Documentation**: Failed to check FastMCP tool registration standards
3. **Inadequate Testing**: No test coverage for tool discovery

## Impact
- Network tools were not discoverable by MCP clients
- Required reimplementation of tool registration
- Wasted development time

## Corrective Actions
1. **Immediate Fix**: Restored tool functionality with proper registration
2. **Documentation**: Created this incident report
3. **Refactoring Plan**: See below

## Prevention
- Always use `@mcp.tool()` decorators for FastMCP tools
- Add tool discovery tests
- Document tool registration patterns
